This code was written by Emma Hudgins and Denys Yemshanov

R scripts are numbered and should be run in order.

The GAMS script (launched using the bash file between R scripts 1 and 2) requires a GAMS software license (https://www.gams.com) and is shared for transparency of model formulation in spite of the non-open source nature of this software. 
Ths script can be converted into an open source MILP formulation and run freely, but note that solving times will be much higher.

Some raw data files are not included because they contain private government surveillance information.

Files are described in comments within the scripts included.
